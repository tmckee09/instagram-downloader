## üîí Permissions & Rules

- Repo is published under the **MIT License** (see `LICENSE`)  
- Only approved collaborators can push directly to **main**  
- **Never commit `.env` files** ‚Äì your API keys must stay private  
- All PRs must pass **prettier** + **eslint** check before merge

---

## üö´ Never Do This

```js
// ‚ùå BAD
const apiKey = "my-secret-api-key";
```

If you push keys to GitHub:

- Public repos expose them to the entire internet  
- Bots scrape and abuse them in under 5 minutes  
- Your API usage will spike and possibly cost you money

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Git & Node.js (first time only)

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e
```

### macOS

Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh  
Then:

```bash
brew install git node
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Clone the Repo & Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmckee09/instagram-downloader.git
cd instagram-downloader
```

Install only a few required deps for API routes
```bash

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Preview the Static Frontend

This project is mostly pure HTML/JS.

Copy/Paste this into Windows Powershell next:
 ```bash
npx live-server

```
It will ask you to Confirm, enter 'Y'

# If PowerShell blocks the script, run 
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser once.
```
Now, you can open your browser and visit:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` ‚Äì Instagram Downloader  
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/tiktok/index.html` ‚Äì TikTok Downloader
