Welcome to the TikTok Downloader project. Whether you're a seasoned dev or just here to vibe code on weekends - you're in the right place. Here's how to get started:

üîí Permissions & Rules

Repo is under the MIT License (See GitHub -> Repository -> MIT License)
Only approved collaborators can push directly to main
Keep .env keys private ‚Äî don‚Äôt commit them!
(.env files store environment variables - usually API Keys, tokens, or config values your app needs to work, but that shouldn‚Äôt be exposed publicly)
üö´ Never Do This:

"const apiKey = "my-secret-api-key";"

If you push API Keys to GitHub:

They're visible to the public if the repo is public

Bots can steal and misuse them

Step 1: Download Git and Node.js

-- Open Terminal and Copy

winget install --id Git.Git -e

--Paste in Terminal -> Type 'Y' to Confirm

--Then Copy:

winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e

-- Paste in Terminal -> Confirm on prompt

After this, you're ready to clone the repository to your machine to edit it. Copy and paste this in terminal:

git clone https://github.com/tmckee09/tiktok-dl.git

cd tiktok-dl

npm install

npm run dev

(After, it should say 'Starting' and then you can go to "http://localhost:3000" in your browser to view the site as it's under construction and view changes you are making to the code in real-time before we push it to Vercel to be shown publicly. Vercel is the host - PM on Discord for access)

// if you get a lucide-react error when running the website locally, just copy/paste this in terminal

npm install lucide-react

npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

//any other error Copy/Paste it into ChatGPT and it will tell you how to resolve it

Need to add breadth to the page now

- An area to Paste a TikTok link - expand on this

Add an API from RapidAPI for downloading Tiktoks from the link
Choose the best domain name / potential to piggyback off of already high traffic sites using the same API
Extend the black top portion to the bottom of the page, then white on the bottom for separation of the top half where the downloader is and the bottom half where the information and how it works goes
Black Colors // TikTok themed as much as possible
Modern/Sleek design
SEO wording within the pages to attract lurking Google searchers
Pages, Pages, Pages - as many relatable pages about downloading TikTok videos, etc as we can create to drive the search optimization
Apps to Access

Github Repository (Need to be added as contributor to see this)

Vercel (Website Hosting - Push final code to this FROM GitHub - when you 'commit' on the project it will automatically upload this to the Live site.)

Node.js

Discord

ChatGPT Plus

VisualCode for better interface while editing locally

Behavioral Signals Google tracks:
-Time on page
-Bounce rate
-Scroll depth
-Repeat visits

Let‚Äôs:
 -Animate scroll & transitions ‚úÖ
 -Consider adding a few interactive elements (e.g. download count, usage stat, or a fake ‚Äúdemo‚Äù preview of how it works)
 -A/B test thumbnail previews, visual hero updates, etc
